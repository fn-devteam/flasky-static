# Language and Localization

This repo is bi-lingual. We can communicate in both English (en-US) or Portuguese (pt-BR) but most of the public facing content will be translated into English as rule-of-thumb.

Two of our collaborators are located in the GMT-3 timezone and one is in the GMT-7 (currently under DST) so keep that in mind when contacting us.

# Current Projects

## Flask Static Sites

Our current project is directed at developing a couple of static websites using the Flask framework. They will likely be hosted on github using Github Pages. 

_The 'Project' tab should have current information about the status of the projects we are working on._
